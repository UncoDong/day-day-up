well most people think that lions only come from ~~Aferica~~ Africa. And you ~~will~~ would be ~~forgiving~~ forgiven  for thinking this because **in fact** most of lions ~~due~~ do come from Africa. But ~~that~~  this hasn't always be in a case. ~~not always~~ .. If we go back, 10,000years, we would find that there were lions ~~revove sectoins~~ **roaming vast sections** of the globe. But now , ~~unfortunatly~~ unfortunately, only **very** small sections of lions ~~for the habitite~~ former habitat remain.  My particular interest in ~~Aisa~~ Asiatic lions which are a sub-~~specieces~~ species(亚种) than Africa lions. At almost a 100,000 years, since the ~~Asia~~ Asiatic **lions split off and developed as a sub-species**  ~~battle vallate from some~~, ~~And that~~ At one time the Asiatic lions was living as far **west **  as ~~grace~~ Greece, ~~the~~ and they were found from there, in the band that spread(传播)  ~~to the~~  **east through various countries of the Middle East**, all the way to India。 ~~And~~ in museums, you can now see great coins that have clear images of the Asiatic lions on them. Most of the ~~data up~~ dated(有日期的) at around 500 BC。 However Europe ~~thought~~ **saw its**  ~~lots of~~ **last** Asiatic lions ~~learning~~ **roaming** free 2,000 years ago. Over the next 1900 years the number**s** of Asiatic lions in the other areas <u>declined</u> ~~deadly~~ steadily, but it is only in 19 <u>century</u> that they <u>disappeared</u> from ~~every where~~ everywhere but India. So how ca you tell **an** Asiatic lion from an African lions, with which ~~is~~ your **are** ~~pobabily~~ **probably more familiar.**  Well in general, Asiatic lion are not as big as African lions. The ~~color~~ colour is more or less the same,  but the ~~apperance~~ appearance of the ~~main~~ mane(鬃毛) is different, that is the hair around the linos face and neck. The Asiatic lions mane is ~~notice to be~~ noticeably(明显地) shorter than the ~~Afferican~~ African lions。 Asiatic lions also have a long ~~foot~~ **fold of** skin on their undersides, ~~which is~~ whereas not many African lions have these.  

Well, I'd like to talk to you now, about the Gir ~~centery~~ ~~centre/center~~ Sanctuary(避难所) in India。 That's where I just come back from. The Sanctuary was established **specifically** to protect the Asiatic lions. As 1,450 square km in area and  most of it **is** forest. They are now around 300 Asiatic lion in India, and almost most of them are in the Sanctuary. But **despite(尽管) living**  in the sanctuary, which makes them safe from hunters, they still face a number of problems ~~servivail~~ that threaten(威胁) their survival. One of this is ~~every present~~ ever-present(adj. 无时不在的) danger ~~a~~ **of** disease. ~~May of them were killed more than third African lions in 1994~~ **This is what killed more than a third of Africa's Serengeti lions in 1994,** and people are fearful that there are something ~~simillar~~ similar could happed in Gir Sanctuary and kill many of Asiatic lions than. India's **lions** are particularly(特别的)  vulnerable because ~~of~~  they have limited ~~in~~ gene ~~库~~ pool. The reason of this is interesting, ~~as~~ it's  because all of them are ~~de~~ **descended(后裔) from a few dozen lions**,that were saved by prince ~~fell doesn't line , the per save by prints~~, ~~which~~ who ~~take~~ took a particular ~~entrance then~~ interest in them. He was very wealthy, and he managed to protect them, otherwise they ~~probabuly~~ probably have died out ~~compaltely~~ completely. When you see the Asiatic lions in India, what you ~~sand~~ sense is ~~your normal~~ enormous vitality(生命活力). Very ~~impresive~~ **impressive** beasts and you will never guess **that** they ~~have~~ had this vulnerability(adj. 易受伤害的)  ~~disadvanbilit~~ when you look as them. The Asiatic lions don't have to ~~go~~ Gir sanctuary to ~~themself~~ themselves  ~~as he siad~~ I should add. They actually share it with about 2,000 farmers. ~~Never of the~~ A significant  ~~propurtaion~~ proportion of lions diet is  made of the ~~life~~ livestock **of these**  farmers- goats,  chicken ad so on. As much ~~the bird~~ as a third in fact.  And **they've** even **been** know to attack humans, ~~escapcilify~~ especially in times of ~~drop out~~ drought. One ~~finall~~ final piece of ~~intresting~~ interesting  information, in ancient India , on of the  greatest  tests of leadership ~~of~~ for a man was to fight a lion.  Now it seems, in ~~morden~~ modern India **it** will be a great test ~~that~~ to see if a lion can be saved. I'm sure this is something that all of you **will** share ~~conserm~~ concern for ~~from~~ too
