#### 精听

Good morning. Today I like to ~~persent~~ present(呈现) **the findings** ~~defining~~  ~~about~~ **of our year** a two project on wildlife ~~funding~~ found in gardens through out our city. I will start by saying some**thing**  about the background ~~of~~ to the project, than talk a little **bit** about ~~the~~ our research ~~ta~~ techniques , and then ~~in decades~~ indicate some of our ~~the~~ ~~interesting~~ interim finds. First of all, how do we choose our topic.  Well, ~~their~~ **there** are 4 of our in **the** groups,  and one day ~~we~~ will we discuss ~~our~~ a possible focus,  two of **the** groups ~~mentions~~ mentioned that they ~~have~~ had seen yet more  **sparrow ~~house~~ hawks** - **one of Britain's most interesting birds of prey-**  in their own city centre  garden, and **wondered** why  they ~~will~~ **were turning up **~~taking up their~~ in these gardens in great numbers.  We were all very ~~ingage~~ engaged(投入) by the idea why wild animals will choose to ~~visit~~ inhabit the city garden. Why is this so popular with wild life when the countryside itself **is	** becom**ing** less **so**. The first thing we did ~~is~~ **was** to stablish what ~~porpution~~ **proportion** of the urban land is taken by ~~protected~~ private gardens. 

We ~~have some~~ estimated made it that ~~has been~~ was about one-fifth, and ~~that is~~ **this was endorsed** ~~indoors~~ by looking out  large skill usage maps in town land ~~service~~ **survey** office, 2~~5~~4% ~~we per~~ to be precise.

Our own ~~informaing~~  informal(非正式的) ~~this~~ discussion ~~was~~ neighbours and friends ~~latest~~  led **us to belief that** many garden owners had interesting experiences to relate **regarding wild animals sightings**   ~~wild animals like exciting~~ , so we decided ~~invited~~ to ~~serve~~ **survey** garden owners from different areas of the city.

Just over 100 of them ~~complated~~ **completed** the survey ~~on~~ once **every** ~~serival~~ two weeks for 12 mouth.~~taking~~ **ticking off** ~~our~~ ~~specieces~~ **species** they had seem from a ~~prom~~ pro forma list and adding their name ~~at moth~~ **of any rarer ones**

meaning well we are doing 

our own ~~application~~ **observations(观察力)**

~~than~~ in **selected** garden ~~out of  the city~~ throughout the city.

暂时没听完，听的有些头疼了，**明天上课前听完**
