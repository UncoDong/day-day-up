非数据图

Then, after that这些词用的不太好

I do it then I do that

I do this and I do that

then只是个插入语，不能起到链接作用

可以用来给句子开头

The data rose to 32% in 2001 however it fell to 7% in 2002

however前面后面都是个完整的句子，不能用however连接，however只是插入语

The data rose to 32% in 2001 but it fell to 7% in 2002

but是连接词，可以



并列主语or相似趋势

decrease from 4% and 5% to 3% and 4% in 6 years.
