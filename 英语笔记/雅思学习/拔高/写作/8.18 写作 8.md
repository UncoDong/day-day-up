论证topic sentence成立

creative => breakthrough



不要写So开头的句子

引导结果从句 => 不能单独成句

不要写缩略体 can't don't

For example/instance , sudoku game requires only one player to  join in and people might find it is difficult to fill all blanks on table as well as following the strict rules. Without help from other people, the player must thinks **<u>about</u>** how to **<u>solve</u>** the puzzle by himself. In this way, **<u>he or she</u>** might increase his ~~intelligence through the thinking~~ and might find a way to win the game quickly.

独立思考能力 independent thinking. (不加skill)
