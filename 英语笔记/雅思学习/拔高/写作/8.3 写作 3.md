## 线图剩下的部分

将来时的静态图：比如2020~2040是一个将来的时态

不会用到will

The data is expected (to rise sharply)./ (to see a sharp rise)

因为对于未来不好预测，所以就用expect这种方式

The percentage of people aged 65 and over rose slightly from 8% percent to 15% in 1940 to 1980



如果两个时态一起用，就要模糊现在的时间点。比如想描述以前持平，未来上升

(模糊时间点)The figure remain stable for about 20 years and 

过去预计

was excepted to increase sharply to 23% in 2040.

不会说是在2020变化的



两段下降，一段上升

The percentage of Sweden decreased slightly and was predicted to continue to fall to 18% i  2028 and grow rpidly to just over 25% in 2040.

如果不是线图，有可能只给一个时间的数据，比如2028的。所以要模糊时间点

过去数据说一下，不带数据，再加上将来数据。

The data of Japan witnessed a slight drop to 3% in 1970 and was predicted to rise to 10% in 2028 and grow dramatically to over 25% in 2040.



## 横跨过去现在将来三个方面的结尾段

### 趋势

一定要写总体趋势，比如那个上升哪个下降。

用<u>**现在时**</u>

In summary/ Overall/ To sum up, the three figures witness a growth over the 100-year period 

### 最值

这次是在将来有最值：

Beside, the figure of Japan **<u>was projected to</u>** replace that of USA and become the largest.

如果特征是贯穿的，那就用现在时

Besides, the data of beef remain(不要用keep) the largest through the period. 



## 别的图

### 饼图

饼图通常由多个，并且内容也多。

可以想象成线图。



起始值的最近特倍。如果变化太简单了，就必须对起始值用这些描述。

否者就单独说一下起始值。

others通常不第一个写。

如果第一个图不明显，可以用最后一个图做参照

主语不是百分比（xxx的百分比占比10%）。主语应该是事物。

The sales of 

#### 想表示一样的时候，伴随状语

Starting from the same data (as adult fiction) in 1972, the figure of children fiction had a gradual rise to 25% in 2012.



The sales of Biography occupied 20% in 1972, **<u>and then</u>** it sew a ~~continue~~  **<u>constant</u>** drop from 15% to 8% in the next 40 years. The data of travel  made up 15% in the first year, **<u>and then</u>** there was a ~~slightly~~ **<u>slight</u>** increase  at 18% in 1992  but soon dropped to 10% in 2012.



 The figure of others between **<u>1972</u>** to 2012  experienced  a similar trend **<u>to that of Biography</u>**  from about 25% to 12% in the number .

修改

 the period between 1972 to 2012 experienced a similar trend to the percentage of Biography from about 25% to 12% in the figure of others.

用不了现在时，只能用过去时和将来时

The bar chart displays the how the proportions of four countries' population change from 1950 to 2050. 

不用比较起始，因为变化比较多。



The percentage of population in china was responsible for a quater in 1950 and then saw a gradual fall to about 24% in 2002 and the data expected to decline sharply to around 17% in 2050.



The data of USA occupied about 7% in 1950, the next 52 years witnessed a slight decline to 5% and then it was excepted to remain stable at that level.  The period from 1950 to 2002 experienced a similar trend in the figure of USA from about 4% to 3% ,and it was projected to continue decreasing into 2% in 2050.

The figure in India made up 15% in 1950, and was predicted to have a continuous increase from 15% to 20% from 1950 to 2050.





The period between 1950 to 2002 experienced a similar trend to the percentage of USA from about 25% to 12% in the figure of others.





Starting from 7% in 1950
