Nowadays, **news are be tend to read** on the Internet by more and more people. **But** there is a view that it **can't** replace the newspaper as the important source of news. In my opinion, I overall disagree with it.

- But - > ,but . But是连词，不能作为主语。

So 应该引导从句，不可以单独成句。

段落开始

To begin with



To begin with, workers are exposed to the Internet while working on the daily basis so acquiring news online can be easier. **<u>Because</u>** most corporations are using the Internet for office,  **<u>so</u>** the employers will have more chance to use the Internet, and also people **<u>are</u>** too busy to squeeze time for reading newspapers, so the online news are more popular. For example, in IT companies, the workers  work overtime  everyday, so they have now way to ~~have~~ **access** news except on the Internet. **<u>So</u>** more employers tend to read online news.



Because和so

so不能单独成句,可以用There for

Moreover, online news **<u>are</u>** mostly for readers, because they could earn money from other ways, like advertisement. As online news company use free news to attract netizens, some manufacturers will find it to promote their products. They could get income from sponsorship, so the news will be free for readers.   Of course, people are attracted by free stuff so they would go for online news.
