T:Ok, Stewart. We need to start <u>planning our paper on</u> public libraries.

planningo ur     papero n

Have you thought of an angle yet?

你想过咱们要从哪个角度开始了吗？



Have you <u>thought of an</u> angle yet?



 How libraries have changed over the centuries, <u>for instance, or</u> how different countries organize them.

for instance - 例如

organize - 组织

organise - 组织





T:Maybe we should <u>concentrate on</u> this country, <u>and try and relate the changes in libraries **to external** developments</u>, like the fact that <u>far more</u> people can read than a century ago, and that the local population may speak lots of different languages.



**relate**

[riˈleit]
vt.叙述,讲,使联系,发生关系

far more - famer



S:We could <u>include</u> something about changes in the source of funding, too.

<span>S：我们也可以提及一些有关资金来源变化的内容。</span>





T:Yes, but remember we're only supposed to write a short paper, so it's probably best if don't go into funding in any detail.

supposed *adj.* 假定的;想像上的;被信以为真的

suppose vt. 料想; 猜想; 以为



S:Right. Well, <u>shall we</u> just brainstorm a few ideas, to get started?

T:Ok. We **obviously** need to look at the <u>**impact** of</u> new technology, particularly the internet.

S:But the digitalized books <u>that are</u> available online for free are mostly <u>out of copyright</u>, aren't they?





 And copyright in this country lasts for 70 years after the author[/'ɔːθə/](cmd://Speak/_uk_/author) dies.





 So you won't find the latest **<u>best-seller</u>** or **<u>up-to-date</u>** information.

**latest[/'leɪtɪst/](cmd://Speak/_uk_/latest)**

所以我们在网上找不到最新的畅销书籍或是更新之后的版本。



<span> Anyway, I find it <u>hard</u> to concentrate when I'm reading a long text <u>on a screen.</u></span>

hard to - how to



I suppose it's just a personal preference.

suppose - 假设



T:Mm. I expected that libraries will go on evolving in the next few years.

evolve *adj.* 进化的,展开的

n. 暗示



 Why don't we make an <u>in-depth study of</u> our local public library as background to our paper?

in-depth study - 深入研究 



S:Yes, that'd be interesting, <u>**and raise all sorts of issues**</u>.

S:好主意，这个应该会很有趣。我们可以提出所有方面的问题。



 For **instance**, um, we could interview some of the staff, and find out whether the library has its own budget, or if that's controlled by the local **council**.

**council**

[ˈkaunsil]

T:And what their **policies** are.

**policy**

 I know they don't allow food, <u>but I'd</u> love to find out what **<u>types of</u>** noise they ban - there always seems to be a lot of talking, but never music.

types of - time of

我知道他们是不允许带食物进去的，但我更想知道他们禁止哪类噪音。那里总是有很多人交谈，但从不会允许播放音乐。



 I don't know if that's a policy or it just happens.

<span>我不知道这是明文规定还是事情本身如此。</span>



 Then there are things like how the library is affected by employment laws.

<span>然后，还有雇佣条款是如何影响到图书馆本身的。</span>



I suppose there are rules about working **<u>hours</u>**, facilities for staff and so on.

 <u>Oh, I've just thought</u> - you know people might ask in the library about local organizations, like sports clubs? our list of things to find out.
