Good morning. Today I like to ~~persent~~ present(呈现) **the findings** ~~defining~~  ~~about~~ **of our year** a two project on wildlife ~~funding~~ found in gardens through out our city. I will start by saying some**thing**  about the background ~~of~~ to the project, than talk a little **bit** about ~~the~~ our research ~~ta~~ techniques , and then ~~in decades~~ indicate some of our ~~the~~ ~~interesting~~ interim finds. First of all, how do we choose our topic.  Well, ~~their~~ **there** are 4 of our in **the** groups,  and one day ~~we~~ will we discuss ~~our~~ a possible focus,  two of **the** groups ~~mentions~~ mentioned that they ~~have~~ had seen yet more  **sparrow ~~house~~ hawks** - **one of Britain's most interesting birds of prey-**  in their own city centre  garden, and **wondered** why  they ~~will~~ **were turning up **~~taking up their~~ in these gardens in great numbers.  We were all very ~~ingage~~ engaged(投入) by the idea why wild animals will choose to ~~visit~~ inhabit the city garden. Why is this so popular with wild life when the countryside itself **is	** becom**ing** less **so**. The first thing we did ~~is~~ **was** to stablish what ~~porpution~~ **proportion** of the urban land is taken by ~~protected~~ private gardens. 

We ~~have some~~ estimated made it that ~~has been~~ was about one-fifth, and ~~that is~~ **this was endorsed** ~~indoors~~ by looking out  large skill usage maps in town land ~~service~~ **survey** office, 2~~5~~4% ~~we per~~ to be precise.

Our own ~~informaing~~  informal(非正式的) ~~this~~ discussion ~~was~~ neighbours and friends ~~latest~~  led **us to belief that** many garden owners had interesting experiences to relate **regarding wild animals sightings**   ~~wild animals like exciting~~ , so we decided ~~invited~~ to ~~serve~~ **survey** garden owners from different areas of the city.

Just over 100 of them ~~complated~~ **completed** the survey ~~on~~ once **every** ~~serival~~ two weeks for 12 mouth.~~taking~~ **ticking off** ~~our~~ ~~specieces~~ **species** they had seem from a ~~prom~~ pro forma list and adding their name ~~at moth~~ **of any rarer ones** ~~meaning well~~ Meanwhile we are doing  our own ~~application~~ **observations(观察力)** ~~than~~ in **selected** garden ~~out of  the city~~ throughout the city.

We ~~would~~  **deliberately** choose smaller ones because ~~their are~~ **they** **were** by  ~~father~~ far the more **typical** in city.

~~Hole~~ **whole** point of the project was to look at the ~~worm~~ norm  not ~~so exception~~ the exception

Alone side this primary ~~reachers~~ **research** on gardens, we ~~have~~ were studying ~~read~~  many books **about** decline wild animal that in~~countrised~~  **countryside**, and thinking ~~about the~~ of **possible** cause of this.

So what do we find.

Well, so much that I just ~~want~~ won't ~~to~~ have some time to tell you about **here**.

Here , if you are ~~interesting~~ **interested** in reading our more comprehensive finding, we ~~profile~~ **prodeced**  more ~~detial~~ **detailed** ~~graphycation~~ graphic representation on the website, and of course any other groups would like to ~~tell~~ talk to you about it.

Just E-mail ~~this~~ us.

What we decided to ~~describe~~ present today  is information just about three ~~specieces~~ species, because we ~~found~~ **felt these** ~~they~~ gave good **indication**  ~~for~~ of the  ~~progress~~ **processes** at work ~~we work~~, in rural and urban settings as ~~hole~~ whole  

The first species ~~in genery make~~ **to generate ** a lot of interesting information ~~is~~ was frog. 

And there was a clear ~~pardan~~ pattern here, they ~~with~~ **proliferate**(激增) ~~their~~ where there is suitable water. Gargan ponds ~~around~~ **are on** increase, rural ponds are ~~just~~ disappearing, leading **to massive migration to the towns**

~~Hichart~~ Hedgehogs(刺猬) are also **finding** it ~~easy~~ easier to ~~look~~ live in urban areas, this times because  their predator are not finding it quite so attractive to live their rural in , so ~~has better~~ have a better survival in cities.

We have a lot of ~~circtings~~ sightings, so all in all we have no **difficulties**  ~~where to prenumber to care their~~ with **our efforts to count their numbers precisely**

Our finally species is the ~~finaest~~ finest  ~~from~~ of a bird singers, the sound ~~rush~~ thrush.

On the decline ~~on~~ the  countryside side, they are ~~expercing~~ **exoeriencing** a ~~regareicing~~ resurgence, gardeners are buying a lot of different plants, which means there's an extensive range of seed around, which is what they feed on.

  Another factor, is the ~~pervising~~ **provision** of **nesting places**, ~~I think~~ which is **actually better in gardens** than country side.

Hard to believe it, but it is true.

~~Insteadly~~  Incidentally,  we discovered that the ~~mess~~ massive ~~of~~ new ~~survices~~ **survey**  on  sound ~~structer~~ **thrushes is about to be launche**d,  so you should keep ~~on eyel with~~  an eye open on that .
