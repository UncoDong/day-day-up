**Neil
**Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. 

**Sam**
 And I’m Sam. 

**Neil
**We all know that sport is great for our health - and if you’re talented it can make you rich. 

**Sam
**Many great champions have found a way out of  poverty through their sporting ability – think of someone like  footballer Maradona. 

**Neil
**But in today’s programme we’re not looking  at the superstars. Instead we’ll discuss how sport can change the lives  of young people from some of the poorest, **<u>toughest</u>** backgrounds on  earth.

**And of course, we’ll be learning some new vocabulary on the way.

**Sam
**Well, I can’t imagine there’s enough space for golf and horse riding in the city, so I’ll say b) tennis. 

**Neil
**OK, we’ll find out the answer later. Just  now we were talking about London but sporting projects like the Ebony  Club are happening all over the world. 

**Sam
**In Cape Town, South Africa, British surfer  Tim Conibear noticed how kids from poor townships hardly ever went to  the beach. So he started giving them free surfing lessons. 

**Neil
**Tim founded the ‘Waves for Changes’ project  and now hundreds of kids go along each week to get “surfing **<u>therapy</u>**”.  Not only is surfing giving them a buzz, it's helping to improve their  life chances.

**Tim Conibear
**Surfing also is quite difficult so you’re learning a very **challenging** skill that takes a lot of confidence. Very small successes which  children have when they go into the water **<u>elicit</u>** a really big <u>**emotional**</u>  response. If you come from a background of **trauma** quite often you’ll have a negative **self-image** and being able to try something new, achieve something new, be **<u>recognised</u>** by a coach or a **mentor** is very very good for your confidence as well.

**Neil
**Most of the surfers have experienced **trauma** – emotional pain and shock caused by very distressing experiences. 

**Sam
**This has given them a negative **self-image** – the way a person feels about themselves, their ability, personality and value. 

**Neil
**Surfing helps kids improve their **self-image** because it’s **challenging** - difficult in a way that tests your ability and determination. 

**Sam
**So challenging, in fact, that the children have a **mentor** – a trusted **<u>advisor</u>** who gives help and support to a younger or less experienced person.

**Neil
**Tim believes that the **<u>concentration</u>** needed to surf makes the children’s other problems disappear - at least for a short time. 

**Sam
**And the results so far have been optimistic,  with a significant reduction in violent behaviour reported among Cape  Town’s young surfers. 

**Neil
**Surfing is quite well-known in South Africa. But what happens when you take a completely unknown sport into one of  the least developed countries on earth? 

**Sam
**In 2007, Australian Oliver Percovich was  travelling in Afghanistan with his skateboard. The children there were  fascinated so he started showing them how to skate. 

**Neil
**The idea grew and a few years later he  founded the organisation ‘Skateistan’ giving free skateboard lessons to  children aged five to seventeen, with a focus on those with  disabilities, from low-income backgrounds and especially, girls. 

**Sam
**Here’s ‘Skateistan’ volunteer, Jessica  Faulkner, explaining how skateboarding reinforces positive educational  messages which Afghan kids don’t always get at home. 

**Jessica Faulkner
**There’s a few things that skateboarding does as a kind of function. It is really quite **challenging** – it’s not an easy sport for anyone whether you’re young or old. And that means that it also teaches quite a lot of **life skills.** You have to fall off a skateboard quite a lot of times before you get better and it really helps children with things like **goal setting** and resilience and determination. Also, and really importantly, we do believe that children should have fun. 

**Neil
**Like surfing, skateboarding is challenging  and difficult. It requires effort and Jessica believes this teaches  children important **life skills** – the basic skills needed to solve problems commonly encountered in everyday life. 

**Sam
**One important life skill is **goal setting** – deciding what things you want to achieve and how you plan to achieve them. 

**Neil
**Along with other skills like determination and resilience, this helps kids improve their outlook on life. 

**Sam
**And to experience one of the most important things – having fun! 

**Neil
**Which reminds me about the kids at the Ebony Club and my quiz question. Remember that I asked you which sport the  club uses to support disadvantaged children in London. 

**Sam
**Yes, and I said, b) tennis. 

**Neil
**But in fact, it’s c) horse riding - a sport normally associated with the elite. 

**Sam
**In this episode we’ve been discussing how  sport can help improve the life chances of young people from tough  backgrounds, many of whom have suffered **trauma** – severe emotional pain and distress. 

**Neil
**Such pain damages a child’s **self-image** – how they see and value themselves in the world. 

**Sam
**This can be improved by taking part in sports, like surfing, skating and horse riding, which are **challenging** – demanding and testing of your abilities. 

**Neil
**Often kids are supported by a **mentor** – a trusted, more experienced friend who can offer help and advice. 

**Sam
**And with this support they learn **life skills** – basic skills everyone needs to cope with everyday problems. 

**Neil
**One important skill is **goal setting** – deciding what you want to accomplish and planning how to do it. 

**Sam
**And of course, sometimes the most important goal is just to have fun! 

**Neil
**That’s all we have time for today. Join us again soon as we discuss more topical issues. Bye for now! 

**Sam
**Bye!
