### 名词性从句考点分析

#### 1. 写作

##### 1.1 主语从句

**满分**：把主语从句放在句末，用it做形式主语。

It keeps a common knowledge that ladies turn to be right.

**It ... that ...**(注意不是强调句)

It is apparent that ... 显而易见

It looks beyond dispute that ... (超越争论)显而易见

It has been widely accepted that ... 显而易见

It is universally acknowledged that... 普遍都被接受，显而易见 

It keeps my argument that ...   -- > I think that

**显而易见在图表当中...**

**显而易见，我们会有一个更好的未来**

主语从句满分句型可以写在作文中任何一句话前面。用来拉长句子。**但不能全都用，用一次就行**

**关于勤奋这个话题已经被引起广泛的关注。**

It is apparent that the ~~topic~~ issue about ~~keeping dog~~ diligence  has been brought into the limelight.

##### 1.2 同位语从句

**(他已经找到了一个女朋友，这件事)(让)(他的家人)(很开心)。**

先想主谓宾

主 谓 宾 宾补

"他已经找到了一个女朋友"是同位语

(The matter) (that he  ~~manages~~ managed to find a girlfriend) (makes) (his superiors) (rejoiced.)

The matter makes his superiors rejoiced, (that he  ~~manages~~ managed to find a girlfriend) 

同位语从句既可放在他所解释的名词后，也可以放在整句话后。

manage to do



**(没有什么)(可以掩盖)(他正在变老的事实)。**

主 谓 宾

(Noting ) (can hide) (the fact/truth) that he is getting old.



河南人都是骗子(这种想法)(是)(不正确的)。

主 系 表

The opinion/outlook/argument proves wrong that private individuals in Henan seem all deceivers.

正式英语中很少用's ,用of短语。

of的所属关系比较强，比如头发in头上。这里用in比较好。



温室里的花朵不能经受风雨，(这个事实)(告诉)((我们)不能(溺爱)(孩子)。)

同位语从句+宾语从句

(The evidence) (that flowers in the greenhouse fail to ~~suffer~~ undergo storms) (indicates/shows) (that ~~we~~ kids should ~~not~~ by no means be spoiled by their senior citizens.)

人称代词作主语可以写成被动。



#### 2. 长难句分析

能够识别各个名词性从句，并能够通顺的翻译出来。

##### 如何识别主语从句

主语在句首。引导词在句首一定是主语从句？​

When I see you I love you.

When I love you is not your business.

###### 2.1 引导词句首，从句没被逗号隔开

**:star:只要见到有引导词在句首，并且从句后没有被逗号隔开，就一定是主语从句。**

(That the plates are moving) is now beyond dispute.

主语从句从句首开始。到 **主句谓语动词** 前面结束。

**没有引导词的动词是主句谓语动词。**

###### 2.2 It ... that

除此之外，在分析长难句时见到it ... that通常都是主语从句(也可能有 **强调句**) that 开始到句号结束

##### 练习

(**Whether** the Government should increase the financing of pure science at the expense of  technology **or** vice versa )(often **depends on** )(the issue (of which is seen as the driving force.))

often 修饰depends on，因此主语在depends on之前结束

whether ... or ... 并列的两个从句共同充当主语。

主 谓 宾

上来用最长的速度找到**主谓宾状从补**，各个地方翻译清楚后，根据中国人说话顺序调整。

financing 有动词，资助

at the expense of  以xxx为代价

vice versa 



**or是个并列句**





(How well the predictions will be validated by later performance ) **depends (upon** ) (the amount, reliability, and appropriateness) (of the information used) **and** (*depends*)  (on) (the skill and wisdom) (with which it is interpreted.)

没有逗号分割，主语从句

名词+名词+定语，定语修饰前面所有名词。

predictions 预言预测

validate 娃累的 使生效，使有效。 

介词+名词+定语 

前面的句子多了一个depends







(It) is generally (agreed) that a (person) (of high intelligence) (is) (one) who can (grasp ideas readily), (make distinctions), (reason logically), (and make use of  verbal and mathematical symbols) in solving problems.

It is ... that ... 主语从句从that开始，句末结束

主谓结构    

主语从句里面是主系表

主系表里面有 **四个** **并列**的定语从句(表语从句 )

grasp   -> make  -> reason -> make 都有对应

因此后面所有的并列都少了两个词，“who can”





##### 2.2 如何识别宾语从句

实义动词后面的是宾语。

实义动词后面是引导词，是不是宾语从句？

He died when he saw me.

这里是修饰died的状语

主语一定是谓语动词的发出者，谓语是接收者。

die是不需要宾语的

###### 实义动词后面有引导词，暂定为宾语从句(状语从句还没讲哟，还可能是状语从句哟)



###### 练习

She said (that) she would marry an old rich man.

宾语从句中that可以省略。只有宾语从句的that能够省略。

I wonder **if** I can pass the National Postgraduate Entrance Examination smoothly.

if 是否 ==> weather

宾语从句中的是否可以写成if，weather可以引导所有名词性从句。



(This alone **demonstrates**) that the television business is no an easy world to survive in. (A fact) **underlined** by statics (shows) that out of eighty European television networks no less than 50% **took** a loss in 1989.

找到实义动词，that开始全都是宾语从句

宾语从句中是主系表

每次先找 **谓语** 再找别的

**out of **在xxx之中



He **believes** (that this very difficulty **may have had** the  compensating advantage of ( forcing him to think **long and intently** about every sentence), **and** thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his  own observations.))

compensate 补偿

intent 认真的

状语乱放

forcing him to think about every sentence **long and intently** 

in doing sth. 在xxx的过程中

in reasoning and in his  own observations.





You have all heard it repeated **that** men of science work by means of induction and deduction ,**that** by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of  sense, managed to extract from Nature certain natural laws, **and** **that** out of these, by some special skill of their own, they build up their theories.

by means为介词短语，不能做宾语，是方式状语。



##### 2.2 如何识别表语从句

系动词后面有表语从句

A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US **is** how friendly, courteous and helpful most Americans were to the,
