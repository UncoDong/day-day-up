### 倒装

#### 1. 什么是倒装句

你爱我吗 do you love me

你去过欧洲吗 Have you ~~went~~ been to Europe.

你老爸是个老师吗？ Is your father a teacher.

**一般疑问句就是倒装。倒装就是把一句话写成一般疑问句的形式。也就是给一句话加个助动词或把be放到句首。**



#### 2. 倒装的具体使用

##### 2.1 否定词放在句首用倒装

**表示否定的副词或者介词短语**

- I can **hardly** speak Japanese.  

情态动词相当于助动词

- Hardly can I speak Japanese.

介词短语

- I **by no means** love you.

- By no means I love you.



##### 一般疑问句

**第一家族为含be动词或情态动词的一般疑问句**，其结构为：be + 主语 + 其它部分？

**另一家族为含行为动词（或称为实义动词）的一般疑问句**，其结构为：**助动词 + 主语 + 动词原形 + 其它**？

Do your parents like English？

- Playing phones **not only** influences the physical and mental health of youngsters **but also** wastes their precious time.

- **Not only** **<u>does</u>** playing phones influence the physical and mental health of youngsters **but also wastes their precious time.**

因为是并列句，因此都是单独的句子。只有之前的句子里面有疑问词，需要到装一下。因此后半句一个字都不动。



在任何情况下都不能忽视保护环境的问题

Under **no circumstances** can we keep a blind eye to the issue of environment protection.

##### 2.2 nor/neither位于句首，表示承前句子的肯定或者否定的倒装

- I can cook .   So can I cook
- I cannot cook. Nor can I 

##### 2.3 so...that...句型，把so引导的部分放句首用到装

- I ~~am~~ feel **so** rejoiced **that** I lose my sleep for the whole night.
- **So** rejoiced do I feel **that** I lose my sleep for the whole night.

##### 2.4 Only 引出的状语位于句首时倒装

- I love you --> Only you do I love :x:这句话没有状语，没法倒装
- I love you deeply   -> Only deeply do I  love you.:o:

- His girlfriend called his name only once.
- Only once **did** his girlfriend call his name
- Only when you need money, **will** you call your mother.
- When romance comes, I will hold his hands.
- Only when romance comes, Will I hold his hands.
- Only by/through taking/adopting these actions, ~~can we~~**(主语不明确用被动！！)** can the problems ~~can~~ be handled as soon as possible.

##### 2.5 as引导的让步状语从句，从句表语可以放在句首构成倒装(前面讲过了)

- Ugly as I am, I am gentle.

##### 2.6 省略if的虚拟语气用倒装

把if省略掉 

- If you **<u>had obeyed</u>** my instruction  ==  Had you obeyed my instruction

- If I remembered you  == Did I remember you

如果每个人都养宠物，环境将会被破坏。

If every citizen(一个人) **raised** a pet in ~~their~~ **<u>his</u>** family, our environment **would** be destroyed.

**用every或者each修饰的时候，都是单数**

### 考点分析

#### 1. 写作

**文化交流不但能促进我们国家经济的发展，而且还能开阔个人的眼界。**

Not only can ~~culture~~ cultural exchange promote economic advance but also make our eye sight broad. 

can remote

**我累的浑身都没有劲了**

So tired do I feel that my body out off strength.

I am **so** exhausted **that** I have no energy throughout.

**So** exhausted am I **that** I have no energy throughout.

**当外面下雨时，只有在自己家里，我才能感到安全和放松。**

Only at home do I feel safe and relaxed.

#### 2. 长难句

**还原到装部分后再做翻译。:star:**

Television is one of the means (by which these feeling are created and conveyed) —— and perhaps **never before <u>has it served</u> **<u>so much</u>  ( to connect difficult peoples and nations {as is the recent events In Europe})

**it never before has served**

电视是一种我们创造和情感表达的手段。或许电视{就像在欧洲最近的事件中那样}以前没有提供如此多的服务/从未起到如此大的作用，去联系民族和国家。

**找主语**

**Only** gradually was **<u>the by-product of the institution</u>** note,  and **only** more gradually still was **this effect** considered as a directive factor (in the conduct of the situation).

the by-product of the institution was noted  only gradually.

this effect was considered as  a directive factor in the conduct of the situation only more gradually.

状语放到句末，was放主之间

这个机构的副产品，是逐渐的被注意到的。----》 我们是逐渐注意到公司的副产品的。

 这种影响被认为是一个指导性的因素。----》我们是逐渐的把这种影响看作这个机构行为中的指导因素。



For example, **<u>they(test)</u>** do not **<u>compensate</u>** for **<u>gross social inequality</u>**,  **and** thus (省略主语) do not **<u>tell</u>**   ( how able an underprivileged youngster might have been **<u>had he grown up</u>** {under more favorable circumstance. ) 

if he had grown up 

测试并不能弥补社会不公平

tell - 分辨

所以测试也不能分辨一个（状语：如果一个没有地位的年轻人在好的环境下长大）没有地位的年轻人可能有多么能干，如果他长大在更好的环境下。
