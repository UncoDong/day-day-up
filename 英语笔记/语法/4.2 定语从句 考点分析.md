### 1. 写作

#### 1.1 只要在作文中见到名词，都可以有意识地加一个定语。把句子拉长

**宠物能够减少孤单**

**Pets** can reduce **loneliness**.

Lovely pets can reduce loneliness.

**Pets** |which look cute ~~and~~ as well as healthy   can reduce loneliness |of  **senior citizens** without any **children** who can take care of them.



**读书能够增长知识**

Reading **books** can add knowledge.

Reading **books** 

- which are very popular in the world 

- which look interesting as well as meaningful 

- which keep beneficial to our physical and mental health.

can add knowledge

books such as 

### 2. 长难句分析

能够找到一句话当中的定语成分，并且能够通顺地翻译出来。

**关键是找名词，只要名词后有一坨东西，只要不是动词，就暂定为修饰这个名词的定语成分(还有可能是状语哟)**

名词+定语/~~同位语~~/~~插入语~~/~~状语~~/谓语(动词)

同位语之前有过比较，并且翻译时不同可以区分。

插入语前有逗号，一眼看出来

状语还没讲

**定语从名词后开始，到主句的谓语动词之前结束**

**用后置使得翻译更好听**

开始找名词

Creating a “European **identity**” \[<u>that respects the different cultures and traditions /定1 which go to make up the connecting fabric/定2 of the Old Continent/定3</u>\] is no easy task **and** demands a strategic choice.

 主系表 and 主谓宾

fabric 桥梁，纽带

创建了一个欧洲身份，这个身份尊重不同的文化和传统。这些传统又构成了链接旧大陆的纽带。这绝非易事，需要一个战略性选择。

In Europe, as elsewhere, **multi-media groups** **have been** increasingly successful **groups** \[<u>which bring together television, radio, newspapers, magazines and publishing houses /定1 that work in relation to one another/定2</u>\]

主句谓语动词：have been

**如果定语在主句*谓语动词*之后的话，定语就从名词后开始，通常到句末结束。**

主系表结构

multi-media groups |  have been |  successful  groups





**一个大定语中通常有无数个小定语。每一个小定语都在<u>下一个名词后结束</u>**

**Some of these causes are** completely reasonable **results** [<u>of social needs.</u>]**Others are** reasonable c [<u>of particular advances /1 in science/2 being to some extent self-accelerating/3</u>.]

两个主系表

另外一些是(在某种程度上自我加速3)(科学2)(特殊进步1)的成果



I love my mother  from BJ /1 which is the capital/2 of China/3.

用/隔开的就是定语



In short, a **leader** [<u>of the new school</u> ]**contends**, (宾语从句 直接引语和间接引语)“the scientific revolution, (插入语 装作没看到)as we call it, **was** largely the (improvement and invention and use) [of a series of instruments /定1 that expanded the reach  /定2 of science /定3 in  innumerable directions./定4]

was在前面，句末结束定语。

innumerable - 无数的

direction - 方向

instruments - 仪器

expanded - 扩充

school 学院，学派



[Astrophysicists working with ground-based detectors /定1 at the South Pole and balloon-borne instruments/定2 ]are closing in on such structures, and may report their findings soon.

Astrophysicists 天体物理学家

ground-based - 地基

 balloon-borne 球载





After six months[of arguing] and final 16 hours [of hot parliamentary debates,] Australia’s Northern Territory became the first legal authority [in the world /定1  to allow doctors to take the lives /定2 of incurably ill patients /定3 who wish to die/定4.]

allow sb to do sth 固定搭配，不能拆





**Whether** to use <u>tests</u>, other kinds of information, **or** (to use) <u>both</u>[ in a particular situation] depends, therefore, upon the **evidence**[ from experience /定1 concerning comparative validity] **and** upon **such factors** [as costs and availability. ]

有and，不能画到最后

and连接两个句子，第一个句子的定语不能画到下一个句子上面。

如果定语句在主句的谓语动词之后的话，定语不再是到主句谓语动词结束，而是到句末结束。如果定语后有连词的话，定语不再是到句末结束。而是到连词之前结束。
