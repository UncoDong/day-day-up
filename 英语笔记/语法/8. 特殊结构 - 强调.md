### 强调句型

#### 构成

It is ... that/who/which

**只有is和was，跟过去式(一般过去，过去将来，过去完成)有关写成was，其他都写成is:star:**

that：人和物

who：只能人

我昨天在街上遇到了我的旧情人

**I met my old flame in the street yesterday.**

current girlfriend - 现在情人

It **was** me that  :x:

**强调句形是一个框，用框套住的内容，<u>原封不动的放到句首</u>:statue_of_liberty:**

It was I that met my old flame in the street yesterday

It was yesterday that met my old flame in the street

It was my old flame that i met in the street

**主谓宾依然不变，It is ... that只是个句型，什么都不充当**



**:star:强调句型可以强调句子中所有的成分，唯一不能强调谓语。:night_with_stars:**

宾语状语啥的都能强调

**强调动词不定式目的状语**

It is to realize my dream that I was considering weather I should depart with my boyfirend.



#### 练习 

有很多的原因解释这种现象.

<u>There exist/remain abundant elements to account for the issue.</u>

**It is** <u>there</u> **that** <u>remain abundant elements to account for the issue.</u>

**It is**  <u>abundant elements</u> **that** <u>there remain to account for the issue.</u>

**It is**  <u>to account for the issue</u> **that** <u>there remain  abundant elements.</u>

##### 写作

写作中所有的句子都可以写成强调句型

**你**{至今}没有**意识**到就是**({因为你交友不慎}，你才没有考上心目中理想的大学。)（从句作宾语）**

So far(至今) you have never realize that because you ~~have~~ had  unfavorable friends, you failed to go to your dreamful university.

So far(至今) you have never realize that **<u>It was</u>** because you ~~have~~ had  unfavorable friends, **<u>that</u>** you failed to go to your dreamful university.



就是我女儿出生以后，我才意识到母亲的伟大。

I reconginzed the greatful of mother ather my daught **was**  born.

It was  ather my daught **was** born that I reconginzed the ~~greatful~~ greatness of mother

##### 长难句

But **it is** <u>the arrival</u> (of new satellite channels ---- (funded partly by advrtisinh and partly by viwers' subscriptions)) ---- **that** <u>will bring about</u> <u>the biggest changes</u>({ in the long term}).

就是新的卫星频道的到来。部分是由广告，部分是由观众的订购费用所资助。将会长期内带来重大变化。



Perhaps **it is** **<u>humankind's long suffering</u>** at the mercy of flood and drought **that** **<u>makes</u>** **<u>the idea</u>** (of force the waters to do our didding) **<u>so fancinating</u>**.

mercy 支配，同情

### 强调句型和主语从句的区别

**强调句型不充当成分，把It is 去掉意思也很完整。**

**It is** ovciously **that** I love you.

ovciously , I love you.

**It is** ovcious **that** I love you.
