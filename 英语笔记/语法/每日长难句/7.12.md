#### 翻译



I shall define him [as an individual ] 

我把他定义为一个~~独立的个体~~ 知识分子

[who has elected as his primary duty and pleasure in life the activity of thinking in a Socratic way about moral problems.

那个人已经被他最初的义务所确定，并且愉快地在生活中以苏格拉底的方式思考道德问题。

#### 答案

句子整体上是一个复合句，主句部分是I shall define him as an individual...；其后的who引导一个定语从句，定语从句的谓语动词是elected，the activity...充当定语从句中谓语动词elected的宾语，这是这句话的最难点，这句话的正常语序是who has elected the activity of thinking in a Socratic way about moral problems as his primary duty and pleasure in life.



I shall define him as an individual / / 

who has elected as his primary duty and pleasure in life / / 

the activity of thinking in a Socratic way about moral problems

我会把知识分子定义为这样的人

生活（人生）中的首要任务和乐趣

以苏格拉底的方式来思考道德问题（的活动）
