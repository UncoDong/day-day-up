#### 翻译

**The Greeks assumed** 

希腊人猜想

[that the structure [of language] had some connection with the process [of thought]], 

与原结构与思维步骤有一定的联系

which took root in Europe long {before people realized how diverse languages could be}.

这种思维的方法澡在人类意识到语言多样性之前就被扎根到欧洲了

#### 答案

句子的主干是The Greeks assumed that the structure of language had some connection with the process of thought，宾语是that 引导的从句。其后的which took root in Europe long before people realized how diverse languages could be为非限制性定语从句，修饰前面的宾语从句；在这个非限制性定语从句中，又有两个状语：地点和时间状语。
